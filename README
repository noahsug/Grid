Working title Grid is a Flash game made with Flixel.

It's very much in progress at the moment, and currently you run around building walls and structures in a wild attempt to not get eaten by the critters.

Current TODOs
-Menu
-Game over / replayability
-Enemy targeting when player is unreachable
-Enemies nom throw blocks
-More enemy types

Bugs
-Turn right after building to build behind player, may get stuck in block

Possible Game Direction
-Two buttons build/destory and upgrade
-Have multiple levels, some random, some set senarios
-Larger map with scrolling cameras

Future TODOs
-Graphics
-Tutorial
-Difficulty levels
